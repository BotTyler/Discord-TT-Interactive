Building and testing involves getting a few components connected and running. After following
setup instructions you need to setup the Docker containers, Frontend, Backend, and sync that
all up with discord developer.
## Frontend
For executing commands related to the Frontend you will want to be in the /Dnd-Interactive-Frontend
directory. All commands described in this section will be run in that directory unless otherwise
specified.
To build the Frontend, run
'''npm run build'''

To start the Frontend for testing, run
''' npm run dev '''

## Backend
For executing commands related to the Backend you will want to be in the /Dnd-Interactive-Backend
directory. All commands described in this section will be run in that directory unless otherwise
specified.
To build the Backend, run
'''npm run build'''

To start the Backend for testing, run
''' npm run start '''

## Docker
There are several Docker commands that are used during the setup, building, and testing of this
application. This section will list some of the common ones that are used and what they are used
for. The commands listed in this section will need to be run from the root directory of the repo
unless otherwise specified.
To check the current status of docker containers that are running you can run:
''' docker ps '''

To pull down the containers run
''' docker-compose -f docker-compose.cf.yml down '''

To pull down the containers run
